>>> types of data
	- input-only
		- USER SET: required on every build, otherwise resets to defaults
		- SYS MODIFY: does not happen
		- USER READ: can technically read but no point
	- input, state, output (ISO):
		- USER SET: defined on construction but otherwise not reset (e.g. on rebuild), can be updated by anyone at any point
		- SYS MODIFY: happens via events (but can also animate after the original events)
		- USER READ: can be done whenever but an event indicates when the value is likely to be updated

- table data pointer for a table view ==> input-only
- UI control styles ==> input-only
- UI behavior flags ==> input-only
- checkbox checked ==> ISO
- textbox text ==> ISO
- textbox selection ==> ISO
- scroll position ==> ISO

>>> basic shared rules
- every output needs a corresponding change event with data indicating which change happened ..
	.. to allow retrieving/propagating the output on change only
- avoid getters/setters where unlikely that access will change (e.g. styles)
	- setters may still be added for convenience (method chaining)
