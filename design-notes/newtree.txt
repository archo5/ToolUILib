target flows
- initial build
- rebuild
- cleanup

initial build is easy
- alloc new
- append to tree
- calls SET-OWNER
- calls ENTER-TREE

cleanup is easy
- if in tree, LEAVE-TREE
- if has owner, UNSET-OWNER
- free resources

rebuild is hard!

hard restrictions:
- cannot reuse tree pointers since they may be changed during Build()
- cannot remove a node from system just because it's detached from the tree
- must support owner-allocated UI elements

currently solved using a pending deactivation set:
- items removed from the tree are added to the set
- items added back to the tree are removed from the set
- items in the set after rebuild have UNSET-OWNER called on them
