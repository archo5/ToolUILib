property lists (that can be mixed with other elements)

label/editor proportions:
- percentage (+optional min.fixed label)
- fixed
- editable (either as percentage or fixed)

number of ui controls:
- ideally 1 per editor and 1 per editor group
	> float -> 1 editor, 0 groups -> 1 control
	> vec2 -> 2 editors, 1 group -> 3 controls

additional features:
- hierarchy support on the label side
- headers intermixed with properties
- drag label to edit number (maybe?)
- custom layout to minimize relayout cost



option 1: each element has an optional label prefix
+ # ctrls is lowest
? additional style memory
? can render it inside margin or similar
? can create label drag/cursor events for label drag
+ orthogonal to headers and special case inserts
- groups would offset the split by default
? each control [+] can and [-] has to be styled separately?

1a: property list parent, items controlled by attributes (how?)
+ # ctrls is second lowest (+1 to total for all editors of a section)
- label not part of element and not a separate element, drag events are not trivial (this is optional though)
+ hierarchy can be taken into account for layout
+ can use its style such that it's shared across all controls by default


common solutions to common problems:
- indents ignore hierarchy
  -> common parent element that computes the label/editor split
- defining metadata for each element
  -> style override inside label element that can be enabled/modified
- out-of-control drag events
  -> intercept the events of a different control (easier if whole control can be intercepted but also ~easy if always "whole parent to the left aka <x0, >=y0, <y1")
