required layout structures:

- edge off
  this is when one of the rectangle sides have been allocated to other controls than the rest of it
  can be combined to remove multiple edges (top + bottom, top + right and so on)
  window menu is one type of this

- calculator
  buttons are aligned on a grid, and can span more than one cell
  size generally adapts uniformly but there may be exceptions

- absolute/fixed
  for emergencies, manual layouts, menus, tooltips, dropdowns, sidebar tools etc.

- table
  tables, tree views, detail views, property lists, settings menus
  this probably requires special model-based controls though, beyond some small amount of data

- scrollables
  can be both containers whose children exceed their size (overflow) and separate scrollbars

- stretch fill
  when all edges have been removed, the remaining area is often the workspace

- 3-slice
  for managing separable sections: A=content_1, B=separator, C=content_2
  should support both absolute and relative positioning, but...
  ...separator has to stay unchanged (accounting for global scale, if it exists)

- docking/partitioning
  possibly done on a higher level, but would be nice to allow customization
